# java-socket
A simple client server java program to send and recieve communication between a single client and a server.

This program will probably not recieve much support since it is just a passion project to better learn how to write in
java, but any suggestion on how to get better is welcome

## requirements
This project was tested using AzulJDK 21 and maven 3.8.7, but it should be able to run on any version of openjdk equal or above 8
